# Wakanda

Wakanda is a stealth isometric turn-based game. All you have to do is not get spotted by the enemies and reach the boss



## Project Technologies
This project is [made with Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and all the source code is written in C#. For the movement of all the actor we've used the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), but we've removed the oblique movement for design purposes.

### Protorype A* implementation

The A* algorithm helped us to count each node the actor has visited in his turn (our game is turn-based so we need to stop the movement after x visited nodes). We've made a preview of the player movement cost, so he can see if the movement he's going to do is worth or not.

## Notes
We know that sometimes the ending videos don't work, that's because we were using and old unity version and the video player is buggy.
